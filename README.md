# MyPythonScripts

These are a collection of random scripts that I wrote, maybe someone can take inspiration from them in one way or another.

Most of these assume you have certain libraries pre-installed, pip install everything u might need.

Currently using Python 3.11, I have no idea wheter different versions might broke some things.
